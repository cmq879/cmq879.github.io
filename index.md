## Earth Lab Earth Analytics Data Science Bootcamp course, Fall 2023

I am a currently a 2nd-year PhD student in Environmental Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am also a research assistant with the U.S. National Park Service Climate Change Response Program (CCRP) where I am analyzing climate change trends in NPS-managed sites. My doctoral research will assess temporal and spatial patterns in ecosystem services, specifically outdoor recreation in national parks and other nearby sites and multiple services of the urban forest of Boulder, Colorado. Additionally, I am interested in the use of climate change projections in different decision-making contexts (e.g., natural resources, human health). My background is in public health, and health services research. 

At CU I am a member of the People, Environment, Economics, and Programming (PEEP) Lab. Find out more about us at [www.peeplab.org](www.peeplab.org).
