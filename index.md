## Earth Lab Earth Analytics Data Science Bootcamp course, Fall 2023

I am a currently a 2nd-year PhD student in Environmental Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am also a research assistant with the U.S. National Park Service Climate Change Response Program (CCRP) where I am analyzing climate change trends in NPS-managed sites. My doctoral research will assess temporal and spatial patterns in ecosystem services, specifically outdoor recreation in national parks and other nearby sites and multiple services of the urban forest of Boulder, Colorado. Additionally, I am interested in the use of climate change projections in different decision-making contexts (e.g., natural resources, human health). My background includes sociology, public health (epidemiology), and health services research. Prior to joining CU Boulder, most of my past work was conducted in different academic research centers or programs. 

Programming-wise, I have been a SAS user the longest, followed by Stata. However, as I move into the environmental space I am primarily using R and python. This portfolio features python and R projects. 

At CU I am a member of the People, Environment, Economics, and Programming (PEEP) Lab, led by ENVS Assistant Professor Steve Miller. Find out more about us at [www.peeplab.org](https://www.peeplab.org).
