I am a currently a 2nd-year PhD student in Environmental Studies at CU Boulder. I am also a research assistant with the U.S. National Park Service Climate Change Response Program (CCRP) where I am researching climate change exposure trends in national parks and also review infrastructure proposals for potential climate change impacts. My past work is in public health and health services research. Recent subject areas of interest to me include climate change, vegetation monitoring, ecosystem service measurement, and policy evaluation.
