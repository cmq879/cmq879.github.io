I am a currently a 3rd-year PhD student in Environmental Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder. My doctoral research examines microclimate variation as a function of tree canopy in Boulder's urban forest, investigates urban forest management practices around the U.S. using mixed methods, and assesses historical and future climate change on public lands. I am interested in temporal and spatial patterns of ecosystem services, how land managers optimize for ES delivery, and the use of weather and climate change projection data in different decision-making contexts (e.g., natural resources, human health). My background includes sociology, public health (epidemiology), and health services research.

#"First" Map Post
A large public research university not far outside of Chicago's famed 
Loop, the University of Illinois at Chicago was established in the 1960s 
near the interchange of two interstate highways and several different 
neighborhoods. It's east campus adjacent to downtown Chicago includes 
a nearly complete list of the colleges one expects to find at a R1 
institution. The west side health campus houses several additional schools
and colleges, including the School of Public Health. 

I'm including this interactive map where you can scroll out and identify 
where the campus is relative to parts of the city you might have visited
if you've been to Chicago before.

I chose UIC for this map post because I studied and worked there for 10 
years , completing a B.A. in Sociology and M.S. in Epidemiology and 
working on health behavior-related community environment research at the
 Institute for Health Research and Policy.
