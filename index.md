## Earth Lab Fundamentals of Earth Data Science course, Fall 2024

I am a currently a 3rd-year PhD student in Environmental Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder. My doctoral research examines microclimate variation as a function of tree canopy in Boulder's urban forest, investigates urban forest management practices around the U.S. using mixed methods, and assesses historical and future climate change on public lands. I am interested in temporal and spatial patterns of ecosystem services, how land managers optimize for ES delivery, and the use of weather and climate change projection data in different decision-making contexts (e.g., natural resources, human health). My background includes sociology, public health (epidemiology), and health services research.
