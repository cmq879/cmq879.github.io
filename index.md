## Earth Lab Fundamentals of Earth Data Science course, Fall 2024

I am a currently a 3rd-year PhD student in Environmental Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder. My doctoral research examines microclimate variation as a function of tree canopy in Boulder's urban forest, investigates urban forest management practices using mixed methods, and assesses historical and future climate change on public lands. I am interested in temporal and spatial patterns of ecosystem services, how land managers optimize for ES delivery, and the use of weather and climate change projection data in different decision-making contexts (e.g., natural resources, human health). My background includes sociology, public health (epidemiology), and health services research. 

At CU I am a member of the People, Environment, Economics, and Programming (PEEP) Lab, led by ENVS Assistant Professor Steve Miller. Find out more about us at [www.peeplab.org](https://www.peeplab.org).
